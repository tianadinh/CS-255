# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well?
The DriverPass project is a client requesting a design format for a website. The website is made to assist the learning and practices of training drivers. 

The client owns the company of DriverPass and would like to see training drivers pass more often on their tests with the help of behind the wheel driving and 
tests virtually. 

The system requested by the client was a simple design where users/students can schedule practice, select driving packages, take practice exams, and on the road training.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One part of my work I wish to revise is adding more detail to my data visualization. Thought it was detailed, I felt there could have been more details in my boxes. 
Although a data visualization is not necessary for the final product, it's much like a rough draft or outline. I think I would have put more work into it so that I can finish
the website with a guideline to resort to.

Also, I would like to improve my ability to consider all sorts of entities such as objects, items, inventory, etc. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
In order to ensure I got all the client needs, I checked over the requirements often. Having a check off list helps sees completion over time. To interpret the needs of the client,
I made sure to create a chart with all the roles (user, mentor, admin, tech support) and their different roles and permissions they are allowed to do.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software with simplicity. Too many boxes, lines, and words can make things feel a bit clustered. I prefer outlines be less clustered, and as much bullet points
as possible. I would prefer to make the final product with more effort than the outline. 

A tendency I do have is to think monotone due to preference of simplicity. I would like to be open minded to strategies best fit for the client rather than myself. Some system design 
techniqures I plan to carry forward is using Lucid Chart. It is a great tool with a lot of foundation to begin with, especailly with the templates I am able to use. It feels
clean and organized to use. 

I would also like to get feedback, I enjoyed getting feedback from peers as I felt a sense of pride for myself. Also, the criticism helped me know my strengths and weakness.
